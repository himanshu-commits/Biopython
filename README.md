The Python script utilizes Biopython to access the NCBI Nucleotide database and retrieve a DNA sequence using a specified accession number. The user inputs the accession number, and the script fetches the corresponding DNA sequence from NCBI. Employing Biopython's functionalities, the script translates the DNA sequence into a protein sequence, assuming that the provided DNA sequence codes for a protein. The results, including the original DNA sequence, the translated protein sequence.

# NCBI DNA to Protein Translator

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Biopython library
- tkinter
- 

```bash
pip install biopython
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/himanshu-commits/Biopython.git
cd Biopython
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Enter the NCBI accession number when prompted.

## Results

The script will display the original DNA sequence, the translated protein sequence, and the protein sequence represented in a 3-letter amino acid code.

## Important Note

Ensure to replace "your_email@example.com" in the script with your actual email address. This is necessary for proper interaction with NCBI Entrez utilities.
